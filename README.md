# Subhadeep Sahoo — Personal Website

This folder contains a lightweight, responsive personal site built from your CV.

## Files
- `index.html` — Single‑page website
- `assets/style.css` — Styles
- `assets/script.js` — Dark/Light theme toggle & persistence

## How to Host for Free
### Option A: GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo named `subhadeep-sahoo.github.io` (or any name).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo's main branch.
3. If you used a different repo name, enable **Settings → Pages → Source: `main`** (root).
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

### Option B: Netlify (drag‑and‑drop)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/ and sign in.
2. Click **Add New Site → Deploy manually** and drag this folder, or connect your repo.

### Option C: Google Sites (content copy)
Google Sites doesn’t host custom HTML directly. If you prefer Google Sites UI, copy‑paste the text from `index.html` into sections there. (Or simply link Google Sites to this hosted page.)

---

**Edit content**: open `index.html` in any editor and change text.  
**Change colors/spacing**: edit `assets/style.css`.  
**Toggle theme default**: add `class="light"` to `<html>` or remove it.
